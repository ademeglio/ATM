# ATM

## Objective
Using TDD, design an `Atm` class and an `AtmClientApp` (with a `main` method) to simulate access and transactions that occur with an ATM (**A**utomatic **T**eller **M**achine). The ATM should require the user to enter a 4 digit PIN (**P**ersonal **I**dentification **N**umber) to gain access.

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks.

Where these instructions mention prompting the user or displaying information, this should be done via console. Also, all of the console input/output should be done from the `AtmClientApp` class.

#### Require a PIN for access
Your `Atm` class should have:

  * an *instance variable* of type `String` called `requiredPin` that holds the PIN required to gain access.
  * a *method* with the signature `boolean allowAccess(String enteredPin)` that checks to see whether a PIN the user entered is valid.

Your `AtmClientApp` class should:

  * create an instance of `Atm`.
  * prompt the user for a PIN number via the console.
  * display either a success or failure message based on the PIN the user entered.

##### Stretch Task

  * Create a *constructor* that allows the required PIN to be specified during object construction.

#### Allow deposits

Add the following to your `Atm` class:

  * an *instance variable* of type `double` called `balance` that stores the userâ€™s account balance. Feel free to initialize this with an arbitrary beginning balance.
  * a *method* with the signature `void deposit(double amount)` that increases the value of `balance` by `amount`.

Add the following to your `AtmClientApp` class (these are all predicated on the user having entered the correct PIN):

  * display a menu, with only one option for now: `Press 1 to deposit funds`.
  * prompt the user to select an option. So long as she selects anything other than `1`, redisplay the menu.
  * prompt the user for a deposit amount.
  * call the `deposit` method on `Atm` to deposit the amount specified.
  * display the current account balance.

##### Stretch Task.
  * add the beginning balance to the Atm constructor.
  * use java.math.BigDecimal to store balance instead of double.

#### Allow withdrawals

Add the following to your `Atm` class:

  * a method with the signature void withdraw(double amount) that decreases the value of balance by amount.

Update your `AtmClientApp` to:

  * offer a `Press 2 to withdraw funds` option.
  * prompt the user for a withdrawal amount.
  * call the `withdraw` method with the specified amount.

#### Allow balance inquiries.

Update your `AtmClientApp` to:

  * offer a `Press 3 to check balance` option.
  * display the current balance when this option is chosen.

#### Input loop

Update your `AtmClientApp`, adding a `Press 4 to exit` option. Keep prompting the user to select an option until they enter `4` to exit, then print a goodbye message.

## Examples

`Enter your PIN: 
1234
Welcome to Bank of We Can Code IT!
Choose an option.
Press 1 to deposit funds.
Press 2 to withdrawal funds.
Press 3 to check balance.
Press 4 to exit.
1
Enter a deposit amount
50
Updated bal is: 150.0`

### Using TDD to build out this project

Here are the following asserts that will allow us to build out all of the requirements above through the process of TDD.

  *an ability to withdraw from that default balance
  *a limit on withdraw based on available balance
  *an ability to make an accurate deposit
  *an ability to allow access by PIN
  *an ability to deny access by PIN
